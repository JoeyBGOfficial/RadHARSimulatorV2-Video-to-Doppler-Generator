This is the upgraded version of my previous work RadHARSimulator V1: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator. This work enables the direct simulation of free-space/through-the-wall radar echoes and maps from human activity captured in videos recorded by smartphones or cameras, employing a method that is not absolutely precise but somewhat effective. Additionally, similar to previous works, we simultaneously release an effective recognition neural network design with both MATLAB and Python implementation.这是我之前的工作RadHARSimulatorV1: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator的升级版本。这项工作能够直接模拟自由空间/穿墙雷达回波和由智能手机或相机记录的视频中捕获的人类活动的图像，采用的方法不是绝对精确，但有些有效。此外，与之前的工作类似，同时使用MATLAB和Python实现发布了一个有效的识别神经网络设计。

I would like to thank my mentors for the platform they have provided me. 

My software has not undergone extensive testing by a large number of users. There may still be areas for improvement during use. I welcome your valuable feedback and would be very grateful!我的软件没有经过大量用户的广泛测试。在使用过程中可能仍有需要改进的地方。欢迎您的宝贵反馈，我将非常感谢！
