### Write Sth. Upfront:

The paper of this simulator can be found here: .

This is the upgraded version of my previous work RadHARSimulator V1: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator. This work enables the direct simulation of free-space/through-the-wall radar echoes and maps from human activity captured in videos recorded by smartphones or cameras, employing a method that is not absolutely precise but somewhat effective. Additionally, similar to previous works, we simultaneously release an effective recognition neural network design with both MATLAB and Python implementation.

I would like to thank my mentors for the platform they have provided me. 

My software has not undergone extensive testing by a large number of users. There may still be areas for improvement during use. I welcome your valuable feedback and would be very grateful!

### Basic Information:

The V2 version of radar-based human activity recognition simulator (RadHARSimulator). This app presents an integrated pipeline for advanced human motion analysis from video and subsequent physics-based radar signature simulation. The process begins with computer vision techniques to extract detailed 3D human kinematics and culminates in the generation and analysis of corresponding radar data signatures.

## II. HOW TO INSTALL

This app is packaged as a MATLAB toolbox. Follow the steps for installing.

1. Download the installer from GoogleDrive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F9DRkECVmazQp6NrIiTMsvBu8ICdDSUD/view?usp=sharing;
2. Open MATLAB and double click the downloaded "RadHARSimulator_V2_Toolbox.mltbx" to install: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90640f77-f664-4d8b-8f78-44993c44e2d5" />;
3. After the installation is completed, you can find the app in your MATLAB's APPs toolbar: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83cc779-d2c1-449c-99a8-7d12597945af" />;
4. (This step is essential!!!) Open MATLAB Add-On Explorer, search and install two supported packages: "Computer Vision Toolbox Model for RTMDet Object Detection" and "Computer Vision Toolbox Model for Object Keypoint Detection": <img width="1918" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d56abf92-33e8-49c2-9b9b-a4d19ea75eda" /> <img width="1918" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48abaa4d-0517-4dc2-a756-15c3036beaec" />;
5. After the above steps are done, the app will run normally. Feel free to use it!
