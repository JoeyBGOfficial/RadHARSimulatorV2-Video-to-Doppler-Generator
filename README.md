### Write Sth. Upfront:

The paper of this simulator can be found here: .

This is the upgraded version of my previous work RadHARSimulator V1: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator. This work enables the direct simulation of free-space/through-the-wall radar echoes and maps from human activity captured in videos recorded by smartphones or cameras, employing a method that is not absolutely precise but somewhat effective. Additionally, similar to previous works, we simultaneously release an effective recognition neural network design with both MATLAB and Python implementation.

I would like to thank my mentors for the platform they have provided me. 

My software has not undergone extensive testing by a large number of users. There may still be areas for improvement during use. I welcome your valuable feedback and would be very grateful!

### Basic Information:

The V2 version of radar-based human activity recognition simulator (RadHARSimulator). This app presents an integrated pipeline for advanced human motion analysis from video and subsequent physics-based radar signature simulation. The process begins with computer vision techniques to extract detailed 3D human kinematics and culminates in the generation and analysis of corresponding radar data signatures.
